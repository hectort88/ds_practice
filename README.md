# Data Science &amp; Machine Learning Practice:

## To solve a problem with Data Science
- Formulate the right question (Measurable Results)
- Gather and Clean the Data (Look for missing, incomplete, innacurate or bad formated data)
- Explore and Visualise: (Graphs, Charts)
- Train Algorithm
- Evaluate Results

### There are several basic machine learning algorithms, including:

- Linear regression: Used for predicting continuous numeric values, based on a linear relationship between the input variables and the output variable.
- Logistic regression: Used for binary classification problems, where the output variable is a categorical variable with two possible values.
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Used for both classification and regression problems, where the output variable is predicted based on the k-nearest data points in the training set.
- Decision Trees: Used for both classification and regression problems, where the input variables are split into nodes based on their importance in predicting the output variable.
- Random Forest: Used for both classification and regression problems, it combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and prevent overfitting.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM): Used for classification problems, where the algorithm finds the best boundary or hyperplane that separates the data into different classes.
- Naive Bayes: Used for classification problems, based on the Bayes' theorem which describes the probability of an event, based on prior knowledge of conditions that might be related to the event.
- Clustering: Used for unsupervised learning problems, where the algorithm groups similar data points together based on their similarity in terms of features.
- Neural Networks: Used for both classification and regression problems, based on a system of interconnected nodes that process information and make predictions.
